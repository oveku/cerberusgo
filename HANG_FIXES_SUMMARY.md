# CerberusGo System Hang Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Thread Accumulation (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `clock_weather.py` was creating new threads every 10 minutes without cleanup, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Fix**: 
- Removed thread creation for weather updates
- Implemented synchronous weather fetching using Tkinter's `after()` method
- Added proper thread cleanup in shutdown procedures

### 2. Network Resource Leaks (HIGH)
**Problem**: No connection pooling, infinite retries, and socket accumulation.

**Fix**:
- Added connection pooling with `requests.Session()`
- Implemented retry strategy with exponential backoff
- Added proper timeout handling (5s connect, 10s read)
- Limited maximum retry attempts to 3
- Added connection cleanup on shutdown

### 3. Memory Management Issues (HIGH)
**Problem**: Framebuffer applications weren't properly closing file descriptors and memory maps.

**Fix**:
- Added proper resource cleanup with `atexit` handlers
- Implemented try/finally blocks for resource management
- Added signal handlers for graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Fixed memory map and file descriptor leaks

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Poor error handling led to silent failures and hangs.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive logging to `/tmp/clock_weather*.log`
- Implemented failure counting with backoff strategies
- Added timeout handling for network operations
- Created proper exception hierarchies for different error types

### 5. Service Configuration Issues (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Services had no resource limits, timeouts, or hang detection.

**Fix**:
- Added memory limits (512MB for main, 256MB for framebuffer)
- Implemented CPU quotas (50%/30% respectively)
- Added watchdog timers (120s/180s)
- Configured proper restart policies with backoff
- Added timeout limits for start/stop operations

### 6. System Monitoring (NEW)
**Added**: Comprehensive monitoring system to detect and prevent hangs.

**Features**:
- Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Service health checking
- Automatic restart on detected issues
- Log analysis for error patterns
- System load monitoring

## Files Modified

### Python Applications
- `src/clock_weather.py` - Main Tkinter application
- `src/clock_weather_fb.py` - Pygame framebuffer version  
- `src/clock_weather_direct.py` - Direct framebuffer version

### Service Configurations
- `config/clock-weather.service` - Main service with resource limits
- `config/clock-weather-fb.service` - Framebuffer service config
- `config/cerberusgo-monitor.service` - New monitoring service

### Monitoring Scripts
- `scripts/monitor-cerberusgo.sh` - System monitoring and hang detection

## Key Improvements

### Memory Management
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown
- File descriptor leak prevention
- Memory mapping cleanup
- Session connection pooling

### Network Resilience
- Connection timeouts (5s/10s)
- Retry limits (max 3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff
- Session reuse

### Error Recovery
- Failure counting with adaptive intervals
- Graceful degradation on network issues
- Comprehensive logging
- Signal handling for clean shutdown

### System Monitoring
- Resource usage limits
- Watchdog timers
- Automatic restart policies
- Health check monitoring

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Update Python files**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp src/clock_weather*.py /home/pi/
   sudo chmod +x /home/pi/clock_weather*.py
   ```

2. **Install service configurations**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp config/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Install monitoring script**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp scripts/monitor-cerberusgo.sh /home/pi/
   sudo chmod +x /home/pi/monitor-cerberusgo.sh
   ```

4. **Enable monitoring**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable cerberusgo-monitor.service
   sudo systemctl start cerberusgo-monitor.service
   ```

5. **Restart main service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart clock-weather.service
   # OR for framebuffer version:
   sudo systemctl restart clock-weather-fb.service
   ```

## Expected Results

- **No more system hangs** after hours of operation
- **Automatic recovery** from network issues
- **Resource usage monitoring** and limits
- **Detailed logging** for troubleshooting
- **Graceful shutdown** capabilities
- **Proactive restart** on detected issues

## Monitoring

Check monitoring logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u cerberusgo-monitor -f
```

Check application logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/clock_weather.log
```

View resource usage:
```bash
systemctl status clock-weather.service
```
