## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters (when reasonable)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

Example:
```python
def fetch_weather(latitude, longitude):
    """
    Fetch weather data from Open-Meteo API.
    
    Args:
        latitude (float): Location latitude
        longitude (float): Location longitude
        
    Returns:
        dict: Weather data or None if failed
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Bash/Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Include comments for complex operations
- Use meaningful variable names in UPPER_CASE
- Check return codes of important commands

### PowerShell Scripts

- Use approved verbs (Get-, Set-, New-, etc.)
- Include comment-based help
- Use proper error handling

## Documentation

### Adding Documentation

- Use Markdown format
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots if helpful
- Keep language clear and concise

### Documentation Structure

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware/      # Hardware specifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup/         # Installation guides
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/        # Usage and troubleshooting guides
```

## Testing

### Before Submitting

1. **Test on actual hardware**
   - Boot test (does it start automatically?)
   - Display test (is output correct?)
   - Weather test (does API work?)
   - Service test (systemd service working?)

2. **Check for errors**
   ```bash
   # Check Python syntax
   python3 -m py_compile src/clock_weather_fbi.py
   
   # Check service logs
   sudo journalctl -u clock-weather -n 50
   ```

3. **Verify documentation**
   - Links work
   - Code examples are correct
   - Instructions are clear
